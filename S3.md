Usher Setup, Amazon S3
======================

AWS CLI version
---------------

These instructions assume you're willing to create a new AWS account
for usher, and that you are familiar with configuring and using the
`aws` CLI tool, which we use to configure a limited-access IAM user
that only has the permssions they need.

There are other ways to configure this (e.g. using the AWS Console),
but the instructions are longer and more error-prone.

1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and setup a new AWS account for use by usher

2. Login to aws.amazon.com using your new Root User credentials

3. From the "AWS Management Console", select the third-from-the-right
   dropdown menu labelled with your Account Name, and then select
   "My Security Credentials".

4. Click on "Create New Access Key" and add the Access Key ID and the
   Secret Access Key to your AWS credentials file (e.g. as `usher_root`).
   Note that this is a TEMPORARY access key we only use to
   setup our IAM user for ongoing use - we will delete this key at the
   end of the process.

5. Create an usher IAM user using your usher_root credentials:

       aws --profile usher_root iam create-user --user-name usher

6. Create an access key for the usher user, and record the Access Key ID
   and Secret Access Key in your credentials file (e.g. as `usher`):

       aws --profile usher_root iam create-access-key --user-name usher

7. Add your `usher` user Access Key credentials to your usher config file:

       # If you haven't already, do an init for your $DOMAIN
       usher init $DOMAIN
       # Add your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from (6) to your usher
       # config, in a `$DOMAIN` section
       $EDITOR $(usher config)

   If your domain is `example.me`, your usher config section might look like:

       example.me:
         type: render

   if you're using render.com for your backed, or:

       example.me:
         type: s3
         aws_key: AKIA1234567890123456
         aws_secret: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
         aws_region: us-east-1

   if you're using Amazon S3.

8. Create an `usher` IAM group and add the `usher` user to it

       aws --profile usher_root iam create-group --group-name usher
       aws --profile usher_root iam add-user-to-group --group-name usher --user-name usher

9. Create an S3 bucket named with the domain you're going to use for
   usher e.g.

       DOMAIN=example.me
       REGION=us-east-1
       aws --profile usher_root s3 mb s3://$DOMAIN --region $REGION

10. Set the S3 bucket as hosting a website

        aws --profile usher_root s3 website s3://$DOMAIN --index-document INDEX

11. Attach an S3 bucket policy making your new bucket public-read:

        echo "{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\": [{\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\"Principal\": \"*\",\"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::$DOMAIN/*\"}]}" > public_read.json
        aws --profile usher_root s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket $DOMAIN --policy file://public_read.json

12. Create a policy giving write access to our S3 bucket, and attach it
    to the `usher` group:

        # Create the S3 write policy
        aws --profile usher_root iam create-policy --policy-name "S3Write_$DOMAIN" --policy-document "{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:PutObject\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::$DOMAIN/*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:ListBucket\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::$DOMAIN\" } ] }"
        # Record the Policy ARN that is returned
        ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/S3Write_example.me
        # Attach the policy to our `usher` group
        aws --profile usher_root iam attach-group-policy --group-name usher --policy-arn $ARN

13. To test, add a few test mappings to usher, and then try an `usher push`,
    which should complete without any errors e.g.

        # Add a few test mappings
        usher add test1 https://github.com/gavincarr/usher
        usher add test2 https://aws.amazon.com/
        usher add test3 https://google.com/
        # Try a push (should finish without errors)
        usher push

    At this point you should be able to see your mappings in the S3 bucket:

        aws --profile usher_root s3 ls s3://$DOMAIN/

    or via the AWS console S3 bucket view.

14. Finally, you need to setup a DNS CNAME record for your domain pointing to
    `$DOMAIN.s3-website-$REGION.amazonaws.com`. So for the example above, where
    `DOMAIN=example.me` and `REGION=us-east-1` we would configure the following
    CNAME mapping:

        example.me => example.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

    Unfortunately, how you do that will depend on how you're managing your DNS,
    which is beyond the scope of this guide.

15. Once you have tested everything and are happy it's all working, you should go back
    and DELETE the access key for your Root User (the `usher_root` Access Key, not the
    `usher` user one) e.g.

         # List access keys
         aws --profile usher_root iam list-access-keys
         ID="AKIA1234567890123456"
         aws --profile usher_root iam delete-access-key --access-key-id $ID
         # And check success by requesting the access keys again
         aws --profile usher_root iam list-access-keys
         # (should return an empty list `"AccessKeyMetadata": []`)


This should now give you a working url shortener, such that urls of the form
`$DOMAIN/$CODE` (e.g. example.me/test1`) should redirect to your mapped url.

Note that you only get `http` mappings via S3 by default, which is probably
fine for standard url shortener use cases. If you need `https` support you're
going to have to use AWS Cloudfront, which is beyond the scope fo this guide.
